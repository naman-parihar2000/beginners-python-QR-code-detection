### Building a Barcode/QR code Reader using Python. 
### Hands-on machine learning project with Pyzbar library
###### I think Barcodes/QR codes are very cool and interesting because they store information in a different format. The fun part about them is we can’t really tell what they are storing until we scan them. It’s like playing a puzzle game. And one more thing that I like about them is they can be part of the physical world and still connects us to the internet world. Isn’t that really cool?
